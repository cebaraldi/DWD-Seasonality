This repository displays the seasonality of observed temperatures at selected German meteorological stations operated by the Deutscher Wetterdienst (DWD). 

The analysis covers a 30-year period, consistent with the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) definition of a climatological normal (WMO-No. 1203), such as 1961-1990, 1971-2000, or 1991-2020.
